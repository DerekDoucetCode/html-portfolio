<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I started out in a technologiest position. My main job was to genererate CAD for designs to simulate.
  The CAD and meshing is called preprocessing. In simualtion preprocessing can be time consuming and can
  be where simualtion gets bottlenecked. It was my goal as soon as I joined my team to find a way to help 
  speed up and streamline preprocessing, which led me down the route of automation.  
</p>

<p>Automation was where I fell in love with coding. I used APIs and SDKs I started to automate my workflow
  During this process I used many different coding languages, such as, python, C++, C#, tcl, and javascript.
When I started I didn't care how I solved the problem but I knew if I kept my head down I would eventually
find the answer. After a year of developing my own code for personal use, there was some interest in it 
within my team and that was when I realized the importance of clean coding </p>

<p>My team had realized that I had a talent for problem solving and experience coding, and changed my role
  to developer. During this time I created my own simple CAD GUIs and added funcitionality all still with
  the goal of streamlining the preprocessing for our simulations. Now that I was working with others it 
  became evident that I needed to refine my skills and learn good coding practices. Over the past couple
  years I have learnt so much and look forward to learning more.
