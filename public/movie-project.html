<hr />

<h3>Warrior</h3>
<p>Awesome story and character development. This movie is very motivational and I have watched it over 5 times now.</p>

<h3>Spiderman: No Way Home</h3>
<p>Easily one of the best Marvel movies made to date. So many hidden easter eggs and great content.</p>

<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>Russel Crow is dope. The man made this movie with the epic battles and acting. </p>
